# The getZipOutput function.
# This function loops through all files extracted from the input file. It
# isolates the unique name of every file into strFileName. All lines are
# counted per file and divided by intDivide. This calculation is then added to
# the output file. A total of all reads is also calculated and added.

# The getZipFile function.
# This function creates a temporary storage directory in the output directory.
# The input file is copied to the temporary storage directory. The input file
# is searched for, based on its .dat extension. This search will output the
# name of the input file which is used to unzip it into the temporary storage
# directory. After unzipping, the getZipOutput function is called.

# This function initiates the correct function chain depending on the file

# depends on what extension the input file(s) are. When working with a single
# file, the calculations are done immediately. When working with a zip file,
# the function getZipFile is called. After calculations are done the temporary 
# storage directory is deleted.
